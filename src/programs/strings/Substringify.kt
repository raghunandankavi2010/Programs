/**
 *  Created by Raghunandan Kavi 14 Spet 2022
 *  Given two lowercase alphabet strings s and t, return the minimum amount of operations on s required to make t a substring of s. In each operation, you can choose any position in s and change the character at that position to any other character.

Constraints

0 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 100 where n is the length of s and m is the length of t
Example 1
Input
s = "foobar"
t = "oops"
Output
2
Explanation
We can take the substring "ooba" and change 'b' to 'p' and 'a' to 's'.
