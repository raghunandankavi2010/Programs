# Sample Programs

 Programs to demonstrate problem solving skills. Challenges solved from various sources like leetcode, hackerrank and other sources. Written in java and partly in kotlin.

**To run in IntelliJ**

1. Clone the repo to desired folder.
2. Right click on the src folder and mark directory as sources root.
3. Go to project structure. choose sdk version and language version. 
4. Specify the out put path like /home/pahttoprojectlocation/JavaPrograms/out.

If you try to run without out path specified you get a dialog. More info at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/23688702/cannot-start-compilation-the-output-path-is-not-specified-for-module. Out folder is not committed to repo as it is not required.
